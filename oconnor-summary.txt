On my third day of Bootcamp, we took an in depth look at Bootstrap, which is an open-source tool for Developers
to create websites and applications. Bootstrap uses a grid-like system of rows and columns to make sites have a 
very polished and clean aesthetic. Though this sounds like a wonderful thing with no downsides, it can be very 
easy to get lost in your HTML using Bootstrap, simply because of all of the div tags that you will need to use...
So it is incredibly important to keep notes in your coding, or pay close attention to your coding. 
	Before class even started, one of the pre-work assignments was to create a site using Bootstrap, 
which is a site that I completed. In completeing the Bootstrap site portion of my pre-work, I learned quite a 
bit about it, and I'd be lying if I said that I didn't love it. I found it very easy to use and intuitive, and wondered
why people didn't use Bootstrap for all of their coding needs! I can say now though, that after the Day 3 lesson,
Bootstrap is a wonderful tool that should be used in moderation. 
	Another thing that I learned on Day 3 was how to effectively use Gitbash to upload to Github! Though I am
not an expert on Gitbash or anything, uploading Lab 3 onto Github on Day 2, I officially started to feel comfortable 
with using Gitbash, which is a huge achievement for me. Finally, the most important thing that I learned on Day 3,
was that I have Imposter Syndrome and that I need to remedy this situation. I am officially in the process of 
squashing my bad habits, thanks to our soft skill meeting. I really appreciated that meeting, and to all
readers of my summary, you have no idea how badly I needed to hear that I was not alone. Thank you all.
